# 🌌 Multi-Dimensional Grid Traversal using Dynamic Programming (3D → 6D)

Welcome to one of my most intense and insightful explorations in **Dynamic Programming** — solving **multi-dimensional grid traversal problems** from **3D all the way up to 6D** 🚀.

This project dives into **how to move from point A to point B in a D-dimensional space**, with movement constraints and obstacles, solved efficiently using **recursive DP with memoization or tabulation**.

## 🧠 What Is D-Dimensional Grid Traversal?

Imagine you're standing at the origin of a D-dimensional grid (like (0,0,0,...)) and want to reach the opposite corner (like (n₁,n₂,n₃,...)). You can only move forward in each dimension.

> 🔺 In 2D: Classic DP Grid problems (e.g., unique paths in a matrix)  
> 🔺 In 3D+: Things get **exponentially complex**, but also **super fun**!

This project answers:
- 🌀 How many unique paths exist in a 3D, 4D, ... up to 6D grid?
- ⚙️ How can we generalize DP logic to solve these efficiently?
- 🚧 Can we handle constraints (like blocked cells or limited moves)?

## 🔄 Problem Definition (Generalized)

> Given a grid of size `d₁ x d₂ x ... x dₙ` (N dimensions),  
> Find the number of unique ways to move from the origin `(0,0,...,0)`  
> to the destination `(d₁-1, d₂-1, ..., dₙ-1)`,  
> moving only forward in each dimension (i.e., increasing coordinate values).
